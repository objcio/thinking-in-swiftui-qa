# Thinking in SwiftUI Q&A

In this repository we'll take questions for our weekly Q&A session during the pre-release phase of our book [Thinking in SwiftUI](https://www.objc.io/books/thinking-in-swiftui/). Feel free to submit a question by opening an issue, and we'll try to answer it in the weekly stream.

The next live stream is scheduled for [Friday the 23rd at 18:00 CEST (9am PST)](https://youtube.com/live/H4sSC7scvRw)

Thanks!

Florian and Chris
