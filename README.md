# Thinking in SwiftUI Q&A

In this repository we'll take questions for our weekly Q&A session during the pre-release phase of our book [Thinking in SwiftUI](https://www.objc.io/books/thinking-in-swiftui/). Feel free to submit a question by opening an issue, and we'll try to answer it. As the book is finished, we don't have any more live streams planned at the moment.

Thanks!

Florian and Chris
