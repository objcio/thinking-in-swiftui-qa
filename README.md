# Thinking in SwiftUI Q&A

In this repository we'll take questions for our weekly Q&A session during the pre-release phase of our book [Thinking in SwiftUI](https://www.objc.io/books/thinking-in-swiftui/). Feel free to submit a question by opening an issue, and we'll try to answer it in the weekly stream.

Thanks!

Florian and Chris
